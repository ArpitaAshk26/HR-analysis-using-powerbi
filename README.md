HR analytics using Power BI entails using Microsoft's business analytics tool to collect, analyse, and visualise Human Resources (HR) data. This method enables HR managers to make data-driven decisions that improve HR activities like as recruiting, employee performance, retention, and overall workforce planning. Here's a full overview of how to execute HR analytics with Power BI:
Power BI interacts with different data sources, like as HR systems (e.g. Workdays, leaves & payroll systems.)
1. Import Data: 
Bring HR data into Power BI from databases, Excel files, or cloud services.
2. Data Cleaning:
Ensure that the data is clean and accurate by removing duplicates, addressing missing values, and fixing errors.
3. Data Transformation: 
Use Power Query to transform the data so that it fits the needed analysis format. This could include generating additional columns, merging databases, or normalising data.
4. Data analysis:
Key HR metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) include employee turnover rate, average time to hire, employee engagement scores, training efficacy, and so on.
5. Data Visualization
Dashboards and Reports, Create interactive dashboards and reports to visualize HR data. Common visualizations includes
5.1 Pie Chart:
A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions. In Power BI, pie charts are used to show the percentage distribution of a single data series.
5.2 Donut Chart
A donut chart is similar to a pie chart but with a blank center. This allows for more data to be presented in the center, often as a label or total value.
5.3 Stacked Area Chart
A stacked area chart displays data as areas stacked on top of each other, showing cumulative values over time or categories. It is used to show how individual parts contribute to a total over time.
5.4 Slicer
A slicer is a visual filter that allows users to segment and filter data on a report. It provides an easy way to filter data by categories directly from the dashboard.
6. Benefits of HR Analytics using Power BI
Improved Decision Making: Data-driven insights enable better strategic decisions.
Increased Efficiency: Automating data collecting and reporting saves time and minimises errors.
Improved Employee Experience: Understanding employees' needs and behaviours can lead to more effective engagement and retention initiatives.
Cost Savings: By identifying inefficiencies and areas for improvement, expenses can be reduced.
